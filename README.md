# Smart Contract Development on TON with Tolk üöÄ

[Tolk](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/overview) is a smart contract development language for The Open Network (TON) blockchain, featuring a modern Kotlin-like syntax. Its compiler is a fork of the FunC compiler, so essentially, you get the same bytecode with a much friendlier syntax and fewer opportunities to make errors (see more on the differences and improvements [here](https://docs.ton.org/v3/documentation/smart-contracts/tolk/tolk-vs-func/in-detail)).

These tutorials reflect my journey into the depths of smart contract development for TON. Each one is a step-by-step guide, with code extensively commented in key areas to provide context and details. Welcome aboard! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
